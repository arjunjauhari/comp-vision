# Computer Vision : Object-Shadow Pair Detection

### Abstract
This project outlines a method of recognizing and segmenting an object­shadow pair, originally
intended for calculating the angle of illumination.  We attempt to tackle this segmentation task by composing
different simple algorithms together.  We design an algorithm using region growing and adaptive multi­level
thresholding to segment an object­shadow pair, and we use a visionX program vrdiff to evaluate and
compute statistics on the accuracy of the algorithm.  We gathered simplistic images with single image to test
our algorithm first, and planned to test it further on more complicated images, but didn’t have enough time.
We were able to get workable segmentation algorithm, good enough, with adjustments, to be used for
calculating angle of illumination for future work.
